                    Hello! My name is Vivek, a passionate and curious Computer Science student currently pursuing my B.Tech 
                    at Canara Engineering College. I have a deep interest in technology and love exploring ways to create 
                    innovative solutions to real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to become a skilled developer, contributing to impactful projects that make a difference. I am eager to 
                    learn new technologies, adapt to challenges, and constantly improve my skills to achieve excellence in my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from coding, I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, and drawing. These hobbies help me stay creative and relaxed.
